# DayTripGenerator
Project 1
This is my first project for my software development class. 

For the project, I have to create a function that will randomly select a destination, form of transportation, an entertainment, and a retaurant for a using looking to plan a trip. 

I will be using different data types, conditionals, functions, and lists. 
Also, I will try to use pure functions with Single Responsibility.
